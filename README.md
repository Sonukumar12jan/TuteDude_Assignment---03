# Functions & Modules in Python

## Task 1: Factorial Calculation
* A function named factorial() is defined which accepts a number as an argument.
* The function checks if the number is negative.
* A loop runs from 1 to the given number and multiplies each value.
* The final factorial value is returned.
* The function is called with a number input and the result is printed.

## Task 2: Math Module Operations
* The math module is imported.
* The user is prompted to enter a number.
* A condition checks whether the number is positive (required for log and square root).
* The following math functions are applied:
  - math.sqrt() → square root
  - math.log() → natural logarithm
  - math.sin() → sine value
* The calculated results are displayed.
